    "A very help(full!) tool is the `help()` function (no pun intended). If you pass any function or Python element to it, it will provide you with the documentation of that object. In addition, you can use one `?` or `??` alongside a function or element in Python to get some general information or the entire documentation string from it, respectively. Use these as your best friends throughout the course. For example,  we can call `?` and `??` on the help function to understand the differences between the two."

    "1. To work in and with Python we need to understand the data Python understands. These data types can be strings, integers, floats (floating point numbers), and booleans.\n",
    "2. To hold on to the data we need we use a combination of variables and data structures. Variables are like buckets that hold information holders in for us, and data structures are these information hlders that contain multiple bits of information in them. \n",
    "3. Data structures can be lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and we can even create our own data structures if we'd like.\n",
    "4. A lot of people have written very useful code that we can take advantage of to save time when we code or, in general, to be more productive. They have packaged their code into libraries and we can download them using `pip` or `conda` in the command line.\n",
    "5. Python allows us to do math even more efficiently that with a regular calculator and it gives us many useful functionalities to modify multiple data types with math operators.\n",
    "6. To ask the users of our programs to tell us things, we take advantage of the `input()` function."
